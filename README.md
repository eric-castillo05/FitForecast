# FitForecast

FitForecast is a machine learning project that aims to predict the date on which a person will be able to lift a given weight on a specific exercise. This project utilizes neural networks for accurate predictions based on training data that includes the individual's training history, physical characteristics, and other relevant factors.

## Introduction

Weight training is a powerful method for enhancing strength, power, and muscle mass. However, determining the appropriate weight for each exercise can be challenging, leading to progress plateaus and potential injuries. FitForecast addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning to forecast lifting capabilities.

## Objectives

The main objectives of FitForecast are:

1. Develop a robust machine learning model, specifically a neural network, for predicting lifting capabilities.
2. Assist gym-goers in planning effective workouts, avoiding plateaus, and reducing the risk of injuries.
3. Motivate individuals by providing a tangible representation of their progress.

## Benefits

FitForecast offers several benefits to users:

1. **Effective Workout Planning:** Users can plan workouts more effectively by receiving personalized weight lifting predictions.
2. **Injury Prevention:** Avoid plateaus and reduce the risk of injuries with informed weight lifting recommendations.
3. **Motivation:** Witnessing progress through accurate predictions can enhance user motivation and commitment to training.

## Methodology

The project is structured into the following phases:

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and prepare the training data for optimal use by the neural network model.
2. **Model Selection:** Evaluate different machine learning models, with a focus on neural networks, to determine the most suitable approach.
3. **Model Training:** Train the neural network model on the prepared training data, leveraging its capacity to capture complex patterns.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the neural network model on the test data to validate its predictive capabilities.
